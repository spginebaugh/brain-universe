BrainUniverse: an AI-powered knowledge repository and exploration platform

1. Overview
BrainUniverse is an interactive, AI-powered web of knowledge designed to help students visualize and track their learning progress, explore new ideas, and build meaningful connections between subjects.
Initially, BrainUniverse will focus on students from 8th grade onward, covering well-defined curricula such as the Common Core. The ultimate goal is that it will evolve into a lifelong learning tool, storing all knowledge a user accumulates and providing insights into their learning trajectory.
The platform structures knowledge in a dynamic, mind-map format, where users start with a central idea and expand outward into related topics. AI-generated lessons ensure efficient, engaging learning while guiding users through personalized learning paths.

2. Objectives
Provide an interactive and engaging way to structure knowledge in a visual mind-map format.
Offer a personalized, AI-guided learning path, ensuring students master foundational topics before advancing.
Enable progress tracking and mastery assessment through standardized tests for structured subjects.
Allow for non-linear learning, where students can revisit past concepts and explore new connections.
Support open-ended learning by allowing users to create their own knowledge branches in less-defined subjects like entrepreneurship.
Implement progress dashboards and gamification elements to keep students engaged and motivated.

3. Key Features

3.1 Knowledge Structure & Visualization (Space-Themed Representation)
Planets & Orbits: Individual knowledge nodes representing key concepts (e.g., Pythagorean Theorem).
Solar Systems: Defined subfields within a subject (e.g., 8th-grade Geometry).
Galaxies: Entire subjects (e.g., Mathematics).
Universe: The full repository of a student’s learned knowledge, evolving over time

3.2 Solar systems structure
Prepopulated Solar Systems: Subjects with standardized curricula (e.g., Common Core subjects) come with pre-set structures.
Mastery Visualization: Nodes change color based on mastery status, offering an at-a-glance view of progress.
Student-Generated Systems: Users can create new solar systems for self-directed topics (e.g., founding a food truck business).
Flexible Exploration: Users can revisit previous nodes and add custom connections between concepts.
User Notes: Students can add personal annotations to nodes for enhanced learning.

3.3 AI-powered Assistance
Personalized Learning Paths: AI dynamically suggests the most relevant next steps based on prior progress.
Context-Aware Question Generation: AI generates targeted practice questions to reinforce learning.
Concise, Multi-Format Lessons: AI provides text-based and multimedia explanations for each node.
Knowledge Gap Detection: AI analyzes student performance and redirects them to foundational topics as needed.
Search Functionality (RAG-based): Users can quickly look up past concepts and navigate between topics efficiently.

3.4 User Experience & Interface
Drag-and-Drop Organization: Users can freely arrange their mind-map for a customized learning experience.
Collapsible Nodes: Users can expand/collapse nodes for better navigation.
Color-Coding & Labels: Custom styling options allow users to personalize their knowledge graphs.
Gamification Elements: The platform will incorporate badges, streak tracking, and milestone achievements to enhance engagement.
Progress Dashboard: A visual representation of a student’s learning journey, highlighting mastered concepts and areas needing improvement.

4. Implementation Plan

4.1 Initial Development Focus
Target Audience: 8th-grade students and above, progressing into lifelong learning.
Platform: Web-first approach, ensuring accessibility via desktop and mobile browsers.
Storage: Firebase for user accounts and learning progress.
Assessment: Standardized test integration for mastery verification in structured subjects.
AI Personalization: Initially, AI guidance will be general, with future enhancements for deep personalization.
Gamification & Progress Tracking: Implementing dashboards and achievement-based incentives to maintain engagement.
Search Functionality: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) will be used to power an efficient search system.

4.2 Future Enhancements (Not Core Features for MVP)
Control Over Difficulty Levels: Users will eventually have the ability to adjust lesson complexity.
Social Features: Potential for collaborative learning and knowledge sharing.
Integration with External Learning Platforms: Future compatibility with tools like Khan Academy, Coursera, and OpenAI.
VR/AR Exploration: Interactive 3D learning experiences for more immersive education.
Exportable Learning Progress: Allowing students to download or share their knowledge graphs.
Advanced AI Personalization: More tailored learning experiences based on individual behavior and preferences.

 5. User stories
Viewing the Knowledge Map
As an 8th-grade student, I want to see my curriculum represented as a visual mind-map of planets and orbits, so that I can easily identify what topics I need to study and how they connect to each other.

Identifying Knowledge Gaps
As a student who just failed a quiz, I want BrainUniverse to automatically recognize my weak areas, so that it can recommend foundational lessons or practice questions to help me improve.

Tracking Progress and Earning Rewards
As a motivated learner, I want to earn badges and track my mastery level in a progress dashboard, so that I can see how close I am to mastering each topic and feel rewarded for my efforts.

Adding Personal Notes
As a curious student, I want to attach my own notes or references to any concept (planet), so that I can revisit my personal insights and remember important details later.

Searching for Concepts
As a busy learner, I want to use a built-in search (powered by RAG) to quickly locate specific concepts in my knowledge graph, so that I can jump directly to the information I need without scrolling through an entire map.

Creating Custom Learning Paths
As an aspiring entrepreneur, I want to create my own “solar system” of business-related ideas and resources, so that I can explore topics outside the structured curriculum and connect them to my existing knowledge graph.
