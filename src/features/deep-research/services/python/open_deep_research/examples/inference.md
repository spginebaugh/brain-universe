## Together.ai's Inference Stack Analysis

**Together.ai has revolutionized LLM inference by achieving 4x faster decoding throughput than open-source vLLM through an integrated approach combining hardware optimization and algorithmic innovations.** Their Inference Engine 2.0 demonstrates superior performance by processing over 400 tokens per second on Meta's Llama 3 8B model.

The technical foundation relies on four key innovations:
- FlashAttention-3 optimization achieving 75% GPU utilization
- Custom-built draft models trained beyond 10x Chinchilla optimal
- Advanced speculative decoding combining Medusa and Sequoia techniques
- Quality-preserving quantization matching FP16 precision

A notable case study demonstrates their efficiency at scale: using just two A100 GPUs, Together Lite outperforms vLLM running on eight H100 GPUs by 30% in common inference scenarios. This translates to a 12x cost reduction compared to standard deployments.

The Enterprise Platform builds on these innovations while maintaining SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance. Major enterprises including Salesforce and The Washington Post have validated its performance in production environments, contributing to Together.ai reaching $100M ARR within 10 months of launch.
